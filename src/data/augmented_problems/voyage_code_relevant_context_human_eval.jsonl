If you want to convert it to a string with the leading '0.' removed, you can use the `str` function and slicing:\n\n```python\ndef get_decimal_part(num):\n    decimal_part = num - math.floor(num)\n    return str(decimal_part)[1:]  # convert to string and remove the leading '0'\n\n# Test the function\nnum = 5.55\nprint(get_decimal_part(num))  # prints: .55\n```\n\nThis will give you the decimal part as a string with the leading '0.' removed."}

Then, we define a function called `mad` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n\nInside the `mad` function, we first calculate the median value of the input numbers using `statistics.median`. This gives us the central value of the data set.\n\nNext, we iterate over each number in the input list and calculate its absolute deviation from the median. We store these absolute deviations in the `absolute_deviations` list.\n\nFinally, we calculate the median of the absolute deviations using `statistics.median` again and assign it to the variable `mad`. This gives us the Median Absolute Deviation.\n\nTo test the function, we create a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and then call the `mad` function with this list as an argument. The result, `2.0`, is printed to the console.\n\nFeel free to customize the input numbers to match your specific use case."}

The function works by treating the input string as a stack of parentheses. It keeps track of the depth of nested parentheses by pushing onto the stack when it encounters an open parenthesis and popping from the stack when it encounters a closed parenthesis.

It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the filtered strings.\n\nThe `for` loop iterates over each string `s` in the `strings` list. It then checks if the `substring` is present in the current string `s` using the `in` operator. If the `substring` is found, the string `s` is appended to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list. In the example code, the `filter_strings` function is called with a list of strings `['abc', 'abcd', 'ab', 'bc']` and a `substring` of `'ab'`. The filtered strings that contain the substring are stored in the `result` variable, which is then printed to the console.\n\nThe output of the example code will be `['abc', 'abcd', 'ab']`, as these are the strings from the list that contain the substring `'ab'`."}

For the product of non-zero elements, a for loop is used to traverse each element. If the element is not equal to zero, it will be multiplied to `total_product`. After the loop is completed, the function will return a tuple of `total_sum` and `total_product`.\n\nThis function behaves as expected for a list of integers, correctly calculating the sum and product of non-zero elements, and returning them as a tuple.

If `n` is divisible by the number, it divides `n` by that number (updating `n`), and if that number is prime, it updates the `prime_divisor` with that number. This process repeats until `n` becomes `1` or less, at which point the function returns the largest prime divisor found.\n\nNote: For large numbers, this algorithm could be improved for efficiency.

Inside this loop, we use another while loop to check if `n` is divisible by `d`. If it is, we append `d` to the `prime_factors` list and divide `n` by `d` repeatedly until `n` is no longer divisible by `d`. \n\nAfter the inner while loop, we increment `d` by 1 and repeat the process until `d` squared is greater than or equal to `n`.\n\nIf `n` is still greater than 1 after the while loop, it means that `n` itself is a prime number and should be appended to the `prime_factors` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `prime_factors` list.\n\nIn the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, we call the `prime_factorize` function with the input `81` and print the result, which should be `[3, 3, 3]` since 81 can be factorized into 3 * 3 * 3."}

Inside this loop, two pointers - 'l' (left) and 'r' (right) are used to find the numbers on either side of the current number 'arr[i]'.\n\n3. For each 'i', 'l' begins one index after 'i' (i+1) and 'r' is initially set to the last index of the array. In the nested \"while loop\", the total of 'arr[i]', 'arr[l]' and 'arr[r]' is evaluated.\n\n4. If the 'total' is less than zero, 'l' is incremented by 1 (to increase the total) and if 'total' is more than zero, 'r' is reduced by 1 (to decrease the total).\n\n5. If the 'total' equals zero, it means that we have found three numbers which sum up to '0'. Hence, 'True' is returned.\n\n6. If the \"while loop\" completes without finding the sum, the \"for loop\" moves onto the next element. If no such triplet is found even after iterating through entire array, 'False' is returned."}

If `n` is smaller than 3, we return the `n-th` item of the list. If `n` is 3 or larger, we keep appending the sum of the last three elements in the list until we reach the `n-th` element and return it. We do this through a for loop which starts from 3 and ends at `n` (inclusive). \n\nThis implementation leverages dynamic programming to efficiently compute the n-th element of the sequence. Searching the list for the last three elements in the list to compute the next number in the sequence takes constant time because the indices of these elements are always known (i.e., at position -1, -2, and -3 of the list respectively), so it does not depend on the size of the list or the value of `n`.

{"task_id": 49, "problem": "The built-in function pow() in Python uses the well-known mathematical property (a ** b) % c = (a % c) ** b % c. By applying this property, we can reduce the number of multiplications in the calculation, because we only need to calculate the remainder after each multiplication. This is especially efficient when b and c are large numbers.\n\nThis property is applied in the algorithm of pow() in Python, which is basically a loop of multiplications. In each iteration, it calculates the remainder of the multiplication result by c, and uses this remainder for the next multiplication. This is why pow(a, b, c) is much faster than a ** b % c.\n\nHere is a simplified example of the pow() function in Python:\n```python\ndef pow(a, b, c):\n    result = 1\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:  # if b is odd\n            result = (result * a) % c\n        a = (a * a) % c  # square a\n        b //= 2  # divide b by 2\n    return result\n```\nThis is a basic implementation and the actual implementation in Python can be more complex for optimizing performance.\n\nIf you are interested in the actual implementation of the pow() function in Python, you can find it in the file \"Objects/longobject.c\" in the Python source code.

The `encode_sentence` function takes a sentence as input and applies a simple character shifting technique to encode it. It iterates over each character in the sentence, converts it to its corresponding ASCII value, adds 5 to it, and then converts it back to a character using the `chr` function. The encoded characters are concatenated to form an encoded sentence, which is then returned.\n\nThe `decode_sentence` function does the reverse process. It takes an encoded sentence as input and decodes it back to the original sentence. It performs the same character shifting technique as the `encode_sentence` function, but subtracts 5 from each ASCII value to get the original characters.\n\nYou can use these functions to encode and decode any sentence by calling them with the desired input."}

It first checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, it immediately returns `False` as the strings cannot have the same characters.\n\nThen, it iterates over each character in the strings using a `for` loop and compares the characters at the corresponding positions using the index `i`. If any pair of characters is not equal, the function returns `False` to indicate that the strings have different characters.\n\nIf the function completes the loop without finding any differing characters, it returns `True` to indicate that the strings have the same characters.\n\nYou can use this `same_chars()` function in your program to check if two strings have the same characters.

Then if we want to calculate fibfib(n), it's just a matter of summing the appropriate previously calculated values.\n\nPython code to solve the problem will be:\n\n```python\ndef fibfib(n: int) -> int:\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Negative arguments are not supported.\")\n    if n < 3:\n        return [0, 0, 1][n] # return 0 if n=0, 1 if or n=1, 1 if n=2 \n    else:\n        fibfib = [0, 0, 1] + [0] * (n-2)\n        for i in range(3, n+1):\n            fibfib[i] = fibfib[i-1] + fibfib[i-2] + fibfib[i-3]\n        return fibfib[n]\n```\n\nYou can run the following checks to verify the correctness of the code:\n\n```python\nprint(fibfib(1)) # Expected output: 0\nprint(fibfib(5)) # Expected output: 4\nprint(fibfib(8)) # Expected output: 24\n```\n\nThis code utilises two fundamental principles of Dynamic Programming - optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. The time complexity of this approach is O(n) as each fibfib(n) is calculated only once and in constant time. We are able to achieve this by storing and reusing the previously computed values."}

It iterates over each string in the array and then iterates over each character in the string. \n\nIf the character is an opening bracket '(', it is pushed onto the stack. \n\nIf the character is a closing bracket ')', the code checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no matching opening bracket for this closing bracket, so the function immediately returns 'No'. \n\nIf there is a matching opening bracket in the stack, it is removed using the `pop()` function. \n\nAfter processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means that all brackets were in pairs and the function returns 'Yes'. If the stack is not empty, it means that there were opening brackets without a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns 'No'.\n\nYou can use this modified code to determine whether the given array of parentheses strings can be concatenated to form a valid string of nested brackets. For example, `verify_brackets(['()(', ')'])` will return 'Yes' because the parentheses can be concatenated to form a valid string, while `verify_brackets([')', ')'])` will return 'No' because there is a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket."}

Python uses `def` keyword for function definitions.\n- `print(tri(3))` is equivalent to Java's `System.out.println(tri(3));`. It's a function to print the output of `tri(3)`.\n- `sequence = []`: This is how you initialize an empty list in Python. Lists in Python are equivalent to ArrayList in Java.\n- `sequence.append(3)`: Python uses `append()` method to add elements to a list. It's similar to `add()` method in Java's ArrayList.\n- `sequence[-2] + sequence[-1] + 1`: Python supports negative indexing. `sequence[-1]` means the last element, `sequence[-2]` means the second last element of the list.\n- `for i in range(4, n+1):`: The `range()` function in Python is used to loop over a sequence of numbers. The range includes the start index, and excludes the stop index. It's equivalent to the Java for loop `for (int i = 4; i <= n; i++)`.\n- `1 + i // 2`: Python uses `//` operator for integer division. It discards the fractional part and returns the integer part of the division. It's equivalent to Java's `/` operator in an integer context.\n- `main()`: it's a calling of the main() function."}

It defines a `Solution` class, inside which there's a function `digits()`. It's a static method, which means it doesn't access any data of an instance of the class (`Solution`). It simply does its work standalone.\n\n2. The function `digits()` takes an integer `n` as an argument.\n- This number is converted to a string with the statement `str(n)`. This is because strings in Python can easily be looped over, similar to an array in Java.\n- After that, it loops over the string (read as digits now), converting each character back into an integer and storing it in `digits_list`. This results in a list of the digits from the original integer `n`.\n\n3. It initializes two variables, `product` set to 1 and `flag` set to `False`. `product` holds the product of all odd numbers in the list. `flag` checks if there are any odd numbers in the list.\n\n4. It loops over each digit in `digits_list`. If a digit is odd (`num % 2 != 0`), it's multiplied to `product` and `flag` is set to `True`.\n\n5. If `flag` remains `False` after the loop, it means that there were no odd numbers in the list, so `product` is set to 0.\n\n6. In the end, the function returns `product`, which is either the product of all odd digits in `n` or 0 if there are no odd digits.\n\n7. Finally, the function is tested on a few cases. The formed object `solution` of `Solution` class calls the method `digits()` and prints its results on several test cases."}
{"task_id": 132, "problem": "Firstly, let's understand the problem. The problem is to determine if given two strings, they can be combined to form a string in which all parentheses and brackets are properly nested. The catch is that these parentheses and brackets can be spread across the two strings. The rules are:\n\n- Every opening parenthesis ( must have a corresponding closing parenthesis ).\n- Every opening bracket [ must have a corresponding closing bracket ].\n- An opening parenthesis or bracket may have other opening parentheses or brackets inside it, which must be closed within the outer one.\n\nLet's use a stack data structure to solve this problem. Stacks follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) rule - the last item to be inserted is the first one to be removed. We use this property to enforce the proper nesting of parentheses and brackets.\n\n### Python ###\nTo solve the problem in Python:\n```python\ndef validate_nested_parens_brackets(lst):\n    stack = []\n    lookup = {\")\": \"(\", \"]\": \"[\"}\n\n    concatenated_string = ''.join(lst)    # Joining both strings together\n\n    for char in concatenated_string:\n        if char in lookup.values():    # If char is an opening bracket or parenthesis,\n            stack.append(char)    # it is pushed onto the stack\n        elif char in lookup.keys():\n            if stack == [] or lookup[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False    # An unmatched closing bracket or parenthesis is found\n    return stack == []    # After going through all characters, the stack should be empty\n\n# Test Cases\nprint(validate_nested_parens_brackets(['(([]', '))[]']))    # Expected output: True\nprint(validate_nested_parens_brackets(['))', '[']))    # Expected output: False\n```\n\nIn above code, we first concatenate the two strings from the list and then traverse through every character. If the current character is an opening parenthesis or bracket, we simply push it onto the stack. If it is a closing one, then the top element of the stack (last inserted opening brace) must be its corresponding opening brace for the string to remain valid.

The remainder of each element of `a` when divided by 3 is counted and stored in `count[]`, by incrementing respective index.\n\nIn next nested loop, we are calculating possible pairs and triples using elements of `count`.\n\nThe logic behind calculating the triples is to find the combinations of 3 numbers from the total number of numbers available. This is a standard formula in combinatorics which is `nCr = n!/(r!*(n-r)!)`. Since we are finding the combinations of 3 numbers from `count[j]` numbers, it is equal to `count[j]! / (3! * (count[j]-3)!)`.

{"task_id": 154, "problem": "The faulty code isn't provided, so let's build the solution from scratch. The problem calls for checking the existence of rotational sequences of a given string embedded as a subsequence in another string. Moreover, these sequences must be considered uninterrupted, and the comparison should ignore letter cases and special characters.\n\nHere is one way to solve this problem by using Python:\n\n```python\ndef cycpattern_check(a, b):\n    # Remove special characters and make everything lowercase\n    a = ''.join(c for c in a if c.isalnum()).lower()\n    b = ''.join(c for c in b if c.isalnum()).lower()\n\n    # Check if b is a substring of a concatenated with itself\n    return b in a + a\n\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"AbcD\",\"aBd\")) # False\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"Hello\",\"ELl\")) # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"Whas$sup\",\"pSUs\")) # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"aB!ab\",\"BAa\")) # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"EfEF\",\"EeFf\")) # False\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"Hi^mensS\",\"sImen\")) # True\n```\n\nNote:\n1. The code first cleans both input strings by removing special characters and turning everything to lowercase.\n2. It then checks if the second string is a substring of the concatenation of the first string with itself. By concatenating 'a' to itself, we have sewn together all possible rotations of 'a'. Therefore, if any rotation of 'b' exists in 'a', the string 'b' must be a substring of 'a + a'.\n3. The code does not explicitly handle the rotations of 'b', which simplifies the problem, considering the rotational matchings are inherently taken care of by the concatenation step.\n\nThis problem requires careful consideration of edge cases and a creative approach to eliminate unnecessary complexity (like dealing with rotations manually)."}
