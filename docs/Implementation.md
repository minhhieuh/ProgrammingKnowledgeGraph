The framework for Context-Augmented Code Generation using Programming Knowledge Graphs (PKG) is implemented through a multi-step process, focusing on PKG generation, information retrieval, and solution re-ranking.

Here's a detailed breakdown of its implementation:

**1. PKG Generation**

The process of generating the Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) involves six distinct steps:

- **Step 1: Dataset Selection** The PKG is generated from a combination of text-centric and code-centric datasets. For experiments, the PythonAlpaca dataset is used for code-centric content, which consists of approximately 143,000 Python question-answer pairs. For text-centric content, the Tutorials dataset, containing 76,600 programming tutorial text, is utilized.
- **Step 2: Block Extraction** This step extracts structured content blocks from the selected datasets:

◦ **For code-centric data:** An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser, named FunctionAnalyzer, is employed to specifically extract function blocks from the output sections of the dataset.

◦ **For text-centric data:** A JSON extraction language model, such as Gemma-2, is used to generate the JSON structure corresponding to the textual content.

- **Step 3: Graph Extraction** This is a two-part process to convert extracted blocks into graphs:

◦ **Graph Extraction From Function Blocks:** Each code block is represented as a node, corresponding to programming constructs like `if`, `for`, `with`, or `try` blocks. The FunctionAnalyzer extracts the Context-Flow Graph (CFG) for each function, identifying code blocks as individual nodes. Each function has three types of nodes: 'function name', 'function implementation', and 'extracted code blocks'. Structural edges capture the relationships between these nodes; for example, a 'function name' node connects to its complete 'function implementation' node, which then connects to its constituent sub-block nodes, reflecting the code's hierarchical structure. Mathematically, for a function *F*, the set of nodes *VF* includes *vFname*, *vFimpl*, and *vFblocki* (for each code block). Edges *EF* capture relationships like (*vFname*, *vFimpl*), (*vFimpl*, *vFblocki*), and relationships between code blocks (*vFblockj*, *vFblocki*). Function-wise retrieval searches over `Vimpl` nodes, while block-wise retrieval searches `Vblock`. When a function call is encountered, a search over `Vname` nodes in the knowledge graph helps retrieve the function call bodies, making the retrieved content self-contained.

◦ **Graph Extraction From JSON Object:** A JSON object *J* (consisting of key-value pairs) is represented as a graph *GJ* with nodes *VJ* and edges *EJ*. Each node *v* in *VJ* represents a path-value pair (e.g., *vi* = (path<sub>i</sub>, value<sub>i</sub>)), where the path is a concatenated string of keys from the root to the current key, serving as a unique identifier. The value is either a primitive type (string, etc.) or null if it's an embedded JSON object or array. Edges are defined between the current node and its embedded keys for JSON objects, or to each list item node for lists. The final PKG is constructed by aggregating these CFGs from code-centric datasets and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from text-centric datasets, using Neo4j.

- **Step 4: Encode PKG** To enable semantic search over the PKG, each node within the graph is encoded. The VoyageCode2 model is chosen as the embedding model, as it is recognized for its effectiveness in code representation.
- **Step 5: Neo4j Graph Generation** After extracting all nodes, their corresponding embeddings, and relationships, this data is imported into a Neo4j vector graph. This is achieved by exporting the nodes and relationships into separate JSON objects and then importing them into Neo4j using the APOC plugin. This Neo4j graph enables efficient knowledge retrieval through graph indexing and semantic search functionalities. The graphs were generated using Neo4j version 5.20.0. For the PythonAlpaca dataset, the PKG comprised 425,058 nodes and 434,518 relations, while for the Tutorials dataset (after JSON conversion), it contained 288,583 path-value nodes and 287,936 relations.

**2. Information Retrieval from PKG**

To retrieve relevant information for a given query from the PKG, the following steps are performed:

- **Query Embedding:** The user's query (`q`) is first embedded into a d-dimensional space using the embedder model (`E`), resulting in `Embed(q)`. Similarly, each node `v` in the PKG has its content embedded as `Embed(v)`.
- **Semantic Vector Search:** The system performs a semantic vector search to identify the node (`v_best`) in the PKG that is most similar to the query. This is done by computing the cosine similarity between the query's embedding and each node's embedding, defined as `Sim(q, v) = (Embed(q) * Embed(v)) / (||Embed(q)|| * ||Embed(v)||)`.
- **Retrieval Approaches on PKG:** Three distinct retrieval approaches are proposed depending on the node type:

◦ **Block-wise Retrieval:** This granular retrieval method operates on code blocks (`v_block`), with results labeled 'Block-PKG'. It aims to capture the most relevant context by focusing on specific code blocks within the graph.

◦ **Function-wise Retrieval:** This method operates on function implementation nodes (`v_impl`), with results labeled 'Func-PKG'. It returns the entire function as relevant context, ensuring information is focused on functional code units.

◦ **Path-value Retrieval:** This method operates on path-value nodes extracted from JSON objects, with results labeled 'JSON-PKG'. Each retrieved data item contains a path pointing to a value in JSON representations.

- **Branch Pruning:** After identifying the most similar node (`n_best`) in block-wise or function-wise retrieval, irrelevant branches are removed. The `n_best` node is modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), `G_nbest`, where nodes are code-blocks or sub-functions and edges represent child dependencies. For branch pruning, a pruned graph `G'_nbest` (where the `i`th branch is removed) is created, and its embedding is computed. The best pruned version (`G_pruned`) is selected by maximizing the cosine similarity between the query embedding and the pruned graph embeddings. This refinement ensures only the most useful information is passed to the generative model. For example, if a query is to count 'boring' sentences, but the retrieved function counts both 'boring' and 'exciting' sentences, the 'exciting' sentence branch can be removed.
- **Query Augmentation:** The original query (`q`) is augmented with the content of the `n_pruned` graph. This augmented query (`q_augmented`) is then sent to the generative model for code generation.

**3. Solution Re-ranking**

A re-ranking mechanism is implemented to address issues of hallucination and effectively select the best solution from multiple generated candidates, as different approaches may excel at different problem types.

The re-ranking process consists of three key steps:

- **Step 1: AST Analysis (Syntactic Filtering)** An AST analysis function (`A`) is applied to the set of initial solution candidates (`C`) (e.g., from Block-PKG, Func-PKG, No RAG, etc.). This step filters out any solutions that contain syntactical errors, producing a subset of syntactically valid samples (`C_A`).
- **Step 2: Runtime Execution (Runtime Error Filtering)** The remaining syntactically valid candidates (`C_A`) are then executed. A runtime execution function (`R`) identifies and eliminates solutions with runtime issues, such as undefined variables, resulting in a set of candidates (`C_R`) that execute without errors.
- **Step 3: Semantic Similarity Check** Finally, a semantic similarity check is performed by comparing the embeddings of the remaining candidates (`C_R`) with the query embedding (`q`). Using the same cosine similarity calculation as in retrieval (Equation 4), the solution with the highest similarity score (`c*`) is returned as the final selected solution. This ensures that even if initial retrieved content leads to hallucinations, the re-ranker can prioritize solutions generated without relying on potentially erroneous RAG-based content.

**Additional Implementation Details and Considerations**

- **Code Generation Models & Evaluation:** The framework was evaluated using various Code Large Language Models (CLLMs) such as CodeLlama-7B, CodeLlama-13B, StarCoder2-7B, DeepSeek-Coder-7B, and the general-purpose LLM Llama3.1-8B. Performance is measured using the pass@1 metric, employing a greedy decoding approach with a temperature of 0 and a token limit of 512.
- **Benchmarks:** HumanEval and MBPP datasets are used to assess problem-solving and reasoning capabilities in Python programming.
- **Retrieval Methods:** For dense retrieval, the Voyage-Code-2 model is used. For sparse retrieval, the BM25 algorithm is employed.
- **Cost Trade-off:** The overall time for PKG generation on the PythonAlpaca dataset is 301 minutes with 12,530 MB of storage, which is higher than VoyageAI (241 minutes, 8,440 MB) or BM25 (44 minutes, 315 MB). However, PKG achieved a 9.4% higher accuracy on average. Neo4j's semantic vector indexing allows efficient graph updates with logarithmic complexity (O(logN) for nodes, O(logM) for relationships), and queries typically take about 3 seconds (O(N*d) complexity).
- **Challenges:** The PKG struggles when domain-specific expertise is required if the graph is not populated with corresponding data. Also, certain problem categories, like string manipulation, pose challenges due to the embedder model's and LLM's tendency to prioritize semantic meaning over structural characteristics (e.g., case sensitivity), which can reduce the effectiveness of PKG-based approaches for these tasks.
